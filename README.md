## dev

A dev container to avoid [supply chain attacks](https://twitter.com/PyTorch/status/1609334425384517633) and other kinds of pain. Goal is to use this for all the AUR/etc packages I use.

- [x] Dev container with my configs
- [ ] Script to make usage easy (e.g. mounting files, copying things over)
- [ ] Actually using this in practice
